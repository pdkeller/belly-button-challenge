# This challenge took data from a JSON file and used it to create an HTML page displaying the raw metadata, a bar chart of the top ten most common bacteria, a bubble chart of all the bacteria of a sample compared to each other, and a dropdown menu of each part of the data set. The dropdown menu was created using the list of names in the JSON file. This dropdown menu was then a part of the intial function and was set to the first element in the list, this being ID number 940. The graphs were created by the buildCharts function and the demographic info was created by the buildMetadata function. Changing the dataset displays would then trigger the optionChanged function which calls the previously two named functions.

# I had some confusion regarding how to write some of the code, so I would like to credit Brandon and Asim with the help I needed to finish this assignment.
